					<h3> Machine Learning: Marketers' Scariest-Sounding Friend </h3>

						<p> May 8, 2016 </p>
						<p>Machine learning. Sounds like some scary future education method fromGeorge Orwell's 1984,right? Well, machine learning is not even remotely close to being as scary as it sounds and can even be used to help improve your business' marketing strategy...</p>

					<h3> What is Retargeting & Why Do You Need It? </h3>
					<div class = "project-content">
						<p> March 2, 2016 </p>
						<p>In today's ever evolving marketplace, the buyer's journey is constantly changing. Many business owners would like to think that consumers visit their websites, decide to make a purchase and then follow through with their purchase intent. However, this is sadly not the case. In fact, only 2% of shoppers convert on the first visit to an online store or website.
						</p>
						<p> Most consumers visit a site, explore and then decide to leave. They may come back to the site months later, or they may not. It could take several weeks for a potential customer to follow through with a purchase and it takes even more convincing to turn a one-time buyer into a loyal customer...</p>

					<h3> 3 Digital Trends You'll Want to Know in 2016 </h3>

						<p> January 12, 2016 </p>
						<p> Content Will Remain In Charge: Creating and sharing meaningful content through digital channels should remain a priority for companies and organizations. Content marketing is a form of inbound marketing that aims to bring customers and consumers to your company based upon the useful content you have to offer them.
